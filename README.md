# Simon Game


Introducing my latest web projectâ€”a captivating recreation of the classic Simon game! Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I've ventured into web development to bring this exciting experience to life.

This project was a significant challenge for me, and I spent hours studying and understanding other developers' code to make it happen. Now, I'm thrilled to share this fully functional Simon game with you and the community.

Test your memory and reflexes by following the sequence of colors and sounds, all in your web browser. It's been a journey of learning and determination, and I'm proud of the result.

This project marks a milestone in my web development adventure, and I'm eager to keep learning, growing, and taking on more challenges. Stay tuned for the GitHub link, and thank you for joining me on this journey through HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!
